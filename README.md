# Movie-Theater-customer-experience-enhancement
Improve customer experience at movie theatre by improving seating, air-conditioning, staff performance and booking process.
Customer feedback and operational data of the theatre from the past three years were analysed. On analysis, it was observed that customer satisfaction had declined steadily due to issues such as hygiene, seating, air conditioning, staff performance, and booking processes.

Improving customer experience is crucial to retaining existing patrons and attracting new ones. By addressing operational inefficiencies and enhancing service quality, the theatre can ensure higher customer satisfaction, increased repeat visits, and sustained business growth across its location.
